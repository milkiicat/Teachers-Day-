Make Mr Lim a thank you teacher poem

Dear Mr Lim,
I'm happy that you're my teacher,
I enjoy each lesson you teach.
As my role model you inspire me
To dream and to work and to reach.

With your kindness your attention,
Every day you are planting a seed
Of curiosity and motivation
To know and to grow and succeed.

You help me fulfill my potential,
I'm thankful for all that you've done.
I admire you each day, and I just want to say,
As a teacher, you're number one!
